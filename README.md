# Pizza-sales-analysis-SQL
🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project 📈
💡 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the The Pizza Place Sales Database, aiming to uncover actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making for a pizza restaurant. Using SQL as the primary tool, the analysis covers:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify underlying sales trends and seasonal patterns.

Schema Understanding: Leverage the database structure (Orders, Pizza Types, Details) for robust sales reporting.

Business-Focused Queries: Address key challenges in sales performance, menu optimization, and demand forecasting.

The ultimate goal is to empower strategic improvements in product offerings, pricing, and operational efficiency.

🎯 Project Goals: Key Analysis Pillars
We focused on four key areas to ensure a holistic understanding of the pizza business performance:

💰 Revenue & Sales Insights
🔍 Extract core KPIs (Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value) to assess overall business health.

📈 Examine monthly, daily, and hourly sales patterns to support demand forecasting and staffing decisions.

🍴 Pizza Menu Optimization
📦 Analyze pizza performance by category, size, and individual item based on revenue and quantity sold.

🌟 Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize pizza pricing and item offerings (e.g., identifying top sellers and underperformers).

🏷️ Pricing and Volume Analysis
💨 Evaluate the sales volume versus revenue contribution of different pizza sizes (S, M, L, XL, XXL) to identify high-value products.

🛵 Analyze the cost and ingredient structure (implied via category) to maximize profitability.

📅 Temporal Trends
💹 Analyze revenue and order trends over time (daily, monthly) to uncover seasonality and high-traffic periods.

🏆 Identify the busiest periods for promotional targeting and operational readiness.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL): Used for data extraction, complex joining, grouping, and aggregation to derive deep business insights.

The Pizza Place Sales Database: The primary dataset containing detailed orders, order details, pizza item information, and ingredient breakdowns.

📊 Insights & Expected Outcomes
Successfully implementing the findings from this project is expected to yield the following outcomes:

🎯 Improved menu strategy based on detailed analysis of pizza performance by revenue and volume.

🍽️ Optimized pricing and promotional campaigns targeted toward high-demand times and high-profit pizza sizes.

🚀 Enhanced operational efficiency by accurately predicting peak ordering hours and days.

💸 Increased overall revenue generation by focusing efforts on the most profitable pizza categories and items.

📅 Clear understanding of sales seasonality to aid budgeting and inventory management.
